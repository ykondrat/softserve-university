                    Google Chrome is a freeware web browser developed by Google.
                    It was first released in September 2008, for Microsoft Windows,
                    and was later ported to Linux, macOS, iOS and Android.
                    Google Chrome is also the main component of Chrome OS,
                    where it serves as a platform for running web apps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google releases the majority of Chrome's source code as the
                    Chromium open-source project. One component that is not
                    open-source is the built-in Adobe Flash Player
                    (that Chrome has disabled by default since September 2016).
                    Chrome used the WebKit layout engine until version 27.
                    As of version 28, all Chrome ports except the iOS port use
                    Blink, a fork of the WebKit engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of 2018, StatCounter estimates that Google Chrome
                    has a 66% worldwide usage share of web browsers as a desktop browser.
                     It also has 56% market share across all platforms combined,
                     because it has over 50% share on smartphones. Its success
                     has led to Google expanding the "Chrome" brand name on
                     various other products such as Chromecast, Chromebook,
                     Chromebit, Chromebox and Chromebase.

                    Mozilla Firefox (or simply Firefox) is a free and open-source
                    web browser developed by Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary,
                    Mozilla Corporation. Firefox is available for Windows, macOS
                    and Linux operating systems. Its sibling, Firefox for Android,
                    is available for Android. Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine
                    to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.
                    An additional version, Firefox for iOS, was released in late 2015;
                    however, because of artificial restrictions imposed by Apple
                    Inc., it is forced to use the platform-bundled WebKit layout engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Firefox was created in 2002 under the codename
                    "Phoenix" by the Mozilla community members
                    who desired a standalone browser, rather than
                    the Mozilla Application Suite bundle. During its beta phase,
                    Firefox proved to be popular with its testers and was praised
                    for its speed, security, and add-ons compared to Microsoft's
                    then-dominant Internet Explorer 6. Firefox was released in
                    November 2004, and challenged Internet Explorer's dominance
                    with 60 million downloads within nine months. Firefox is the
                    spiritual successor of Netscape Navigator, as the Mozilla
                    community was created by Netscape in 1998 before their acquisition by AOL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Firefox usage grew to a peak of 32% at the end of 2009,
                     temporarily making version 3.5 the world's most popular browser.
                     Usage then declined in competition with Google Chrome.
                     As of January 2018, Firefox has between 5.66% and 11.87%
                     of worldwide usage as a "desktop" browser, making it the
                     second most popular web browser. Firefox is still the most
                     popular desktop browser in Cuba (even most popular overall at
                     62.77%) and Eritrea with 78.3% and 82.96% of the market share,
                     respectively. According to Mozilla, as of December 2014 there
                     were half a billion Firefox users around the world.
